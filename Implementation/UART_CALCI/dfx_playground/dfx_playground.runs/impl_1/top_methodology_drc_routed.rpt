2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin inst_shift/data_out_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin inst_shift/data_out_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin inst_shift/data_out_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin inst_shift/data_out_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

DFX-1#1 Warning
Multiple Reconfigurable Modules Share Driver  
Reconfigurable modules 'inst_shift inst_count ' are driven by the same cell 'rst_n_IBUF_inst'. In Dynamic Function eXchange flow, this type of boundary connection is sub-optimal. It is recommended that different reconfigurable modules do not share the same driving cells.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst_n relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk.
Related violations: <none>
