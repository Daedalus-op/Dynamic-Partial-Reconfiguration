# Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration
## Final
- [What is it](Intro.md)
- [Types](Types.md)
- [Application](Application.md)
- [Implementation](Implementation.md)

## TODO
- [-] PPTs Combination
- [-] Implement reconfig on an FPGA
  - [ ] Coarse grained & fine grained
  - [-] Profile the performance from above experiments
- [ ] Research
  - [ ] Implementation flows
    - [ ] Vitis AI
    - [ ] Apache TVM

## On Hold
- [ ] Things we can implement
  - [ ] Riscv core (parallel architecture like NPU/ any other accelerator)
  - [ ] Graph partitioning
  - [ ] Mapparat / Matanalysis
