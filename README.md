# Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration
## Final
- [What is it](Intro.md)
- [Types](Types.md)
- [Application](Application.md)
- [Implementation](Implementation.md)

## TODO
- PPTs
- Implement reconfig on an FPGA
  - Coarse grained & fine grained
  - Profile the performance from above experiments
- Things we can implement
  - Riscv core
  - Graph partitioning
  - Memory (from verification)
